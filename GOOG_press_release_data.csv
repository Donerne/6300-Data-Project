2014-11-04,レノボがグーグルからのモトローラ・モビリティの買収を完了,米ノースカロライナ州リサーチ・トライアングル・パーク & カリフォルニア州マウンテンビュー--(BUSINESS WIRE)--（ビジネスワイヤ） -- レノボ（HKSE：0992）（PINK SHEETS：LNVGY）とグーグル（NASDAQ：GOOG）は本日、レノボがグーグルからのモトローラ・モビリティの買収を完了させたと発表しました。 モトローラ・ブランド、そしてMOTO X、MOTO G、MOTO E、DROIDTMシリーズといったモトローラの革新的なスマートフォンのポートフォリオ、さらにモトローラの将来的な製品ロードマップを買収したことで、レノボは世界第3位のスマートフォンメーカーの地位につくことになります。 レノボはモトローラを完全所有子会社として運営します。モトローラの本社は、引き続きシカゴに置きます。買収完了に伴い、レノボは新たな製品ポートフォリオと共に、米国にいる約2800人を含め、世界各地の約3500人の従業員を迎え入れます。これらの従業員は、モトローラの卓越したデバイスのデザイン・設計・販売・サポートを担当します。 レノボの楊元慶会長兼最高経営責任者（CEO）は、次のように述べています。「私たちは本日、レノボとモトローラにとって歴史的なマイルストーンを達成しました。両社は力を合わせ、世界のスマートフォン市場で競い、成長し、勝ち抜く準備が整っています。強固なナンバー3としての地位を築き、スマートフォン市場の上位2社を猛追する信頼できる有力企業となることで、これまで市場が求めていたもの、すなわち選択肢、競争、革新のひらめきを提供します。両社の提携は、もとより理想的な組み合わせでした。レノボは明確な戦略と素晴らしい世界的規模、そして実証済みの卓越した事業能力を持っています。モトローラは米国やその他の成熟市場で確たるプレゼンスがあり、通信キャリアと構築してきたよい関係、象徴的なブランド、強力なIPポートフォリオ、極めて有能なチームを抱えています。勝利が約束された、申し分のない組み合わせです。」 グーグルのラリー・ペイジCEOは、次のように語っています。「モトローラを安心してレノボに任せることができるのは、同社が素晴らしいデバイスの開発に全力で取り組んでいるからです。」 レノボのモバイル事業グループ担当エグゼクティブバイスプレジデントのリュー・ジュン氏が、モトローラ取締役会議長を務めます。モトローラでの経験が豊富なベテランのリック・オステーロー氏は、モトローラ社長兼最高執行責任者（COO）に留任します。 リュー・ジュン氏は、次のように語っています。「モトローラはすでに市場で力強い勢いを得ており、同社の最近の業績は、消費者がデザインとシンプルさが光る同社の優れた製品に大きな期待を寄せていることを示しています。両社が補完的な強みを持ち寄ることで、今年はスマートフォンとタブレットを含め、1億台以上のモバイル機器を販売できる見通しです。そのために中国市場におけるレノボ・ブランドの主導的立場、両社の新興市場での勢い、そしてモトローラの米国などの成熟市場での強固な足場を活用します。」 すでにモトローラは、大成功を収めた新製品のリリースや画期的な革新により、市場で勢いを増しており、堅調に成長しています。スマートフォン以外にも、MOTO 360ウォッチが消費者の関心を集めており、モトローラはモバイル機器の新興分野に事業を拡大している企業としても、地位を確立しています。前述の通り、レノボは4～6四半期の間にモトローラの事業を黒字に転換させる予定です。 グーグルはモトローラ・モビリティの特許ポートフォリオの大半を引き続き所有し、モトローラはこの充実した特許ポートフォリオやその他の知的財産のライセンス供与を受けます。モトローラは2000件以上の特許資産、多数の特許クロスライセンス契約、そしてモトローラ・モビリティのブランドと商標ポートフォリオを保持します。 買収総額は約29億1000万米ドル（買収完了後に調整）で、これには現金約6億6000万米ドルと、新たに発行されたレノボの株式5億1910万7215株が含まれます。買収完了時にグーグルに譲渡されたレノボの株式は、時価総額7億5000万米ドルで、レノボの発行済み株式の約4.7パーセントに相当します。レノボは残15億米ドルを3年満期の約束手形でグーグルに支払います。レノボはそのほか、買収完了時にモトローラが保有していた現金および運転資金として、約2億2800万米ドルをグーグルに支払っています。 この買収取引は米国、中国、EU、ブラジル、メキシコの競争当局が定めるすべての規制要件と慣習的な取引完了条件を満たしており、対米外国投資委員会（CFIUS）からも認可を得ています。レノボがCFIUSから米国事業の買収で認可を受けたのは、2005年以来、本件で5件目になります。 レノボについて レノボ（HKSE：992）（ADR：LNVGY）はフォーチュン・グローバル500社に選ばれている390億ドル規模のリーダー企業として、消費者、商用、エンターテインメント向けの革新的技術を提供しています。当社の高品質でセキュアな製品とサービスのポートフォリオには、PC（名高いTHINKブランドやマルチモードのYOGAブランド他）、ワークステーション、サーバー、ストレージ、スマートTV、そしてスマートフォン（モトローラ・ブランドを含む）、タブレット、アプリを含むモバイル製品ファミリーを網羅しています。リンクトイン、フェイスブック、ツイッター（@LENOVO）で当社をフォローするか、WWW.LENOVO.COMをご覧ください。

2012-08-07,"IVANPAH SOLAR PROJECT REACHES HALFWAY MARK AND PEAK OF CONSTRUCTION 
      EMPLOYMENT","IVANPAH, CALIF.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NRG ENERGY, GOOGLE, BRIGHTSOURCE ENERGY AND CONSTRUCTION PARTNER BECHTEL ANNOUNCED THAT THE IVANPAH SOLAR ELECTRIC GENERATING SYSTEM (IVANPAH SEGS) HAS REACHED THE HALFWAY MARK OF CONSTRUCTION ON THE WORLD’S LARGEST SOLAR THERMAL PROJECT. IVANPAH HAS ALSO REACHED ITS PEAK CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE, WITH MORE THAN 2,100 CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND PROJECT SUPPORT STAFF ON-SITE. THE $2.2 BILLION PROJECT IS ON-TRACK TO BE COMPLETE IN 2013. “LARGE-SCALE SOLAR PROJECTS LIKE IVANPAH CREATE THOUSANDS OF CONSTRUCTION JOBS AND PROVIDE CLEAN, RENEWABLE POWER TO HELP MEET STATE RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS,” SAID TOM DOYLE, CEO OF NRG SOLAR. “WE BELIEVE THAT ENCOURAGING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN OUR DOMESTIC CLEAN ENERGY INDUSTRY THROUGH SUCCESSFUL PROJECTS LIKE IVANPAH ULTIMATELY WILL PAY DIVIDENDS BY HELPING TO SECURE OUR COUNTRY’S ECONOMIC FUTURE.” “IVANPAH IS AN ICONIC INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT THAT WILL SET THE COURSE FOR THE FUTURE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY IN THE US AND AROUND THE WORLD,” SAID JOHN WOOLARD, PRESIDENT & CEO, BRIGHTSOURCE ENERGY. “WE ARE TREMENDOUSLY PROUD OF THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS BEING MADE TOWARDS IVANPAH’S COMPLETION, AND LOOK FORWARD TO POWERING CALIFORNIA’S HOMES AND BUSINESSES WITH CLEAN AND RELIABLE ELECTRICITY IN THE COMING YEAR.” “IVANPAH WILL BE THE LARGEST PROJECT IN THE WORLD TO USE THIS POTENTIALLY TRANSFORMATIVE SOLAR TECHNOLOGY,” SAID RICK NEEDHAM, DIRECTOR OF ENERGY & SUSTAINABILITY FOR GOOGLE. “WE HOPE THAT OUR SUPPORT SPURS FURTHER INVESTMENT TO DEPLOY INNOVATIVE, SCALABLE RENEWABLE ENERGY SOLUTIONS AROUND THE WORLD.” ABOUT THE IVANPAH PROJECT THE 370 (NET) MEGAWATT IVANPAH SOLAR POWER FACILITY IS LOCATED ON APPROXIMATELY 3,500 ACRES OF FEDERAL LAND IN CALIFORNIA’S MOJAVE DESERT MANAGED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR‘S BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT (BLM). THE THREE INDIVIDUAL POWER PLANTS AT IVANPAH WILL FEATURE BRIGHTSOURCE ENERGY’S SOLAR THERMAL POWER TOWER TECHNOLOGY TO PRODUCE CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY FROM THE SUN. WHEN COMPLETED IN 2013, THE FACILITY WILL NEARLY DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF SOLAR THERMAL ELECTRICITY PRODUCED IN THE US. POWER GENERATED FROM THE PLANTS WILL BE SOLD UNDER SEPARATE CONTRACTS WITH PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC (PG&E) AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON (SCE). THE FIRST UNIT WILL BEGIN SUPPLYING POWER TO PG&E IN MID 2013, WITH UNITS TWO AND THREE DELIVERING POWER TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND PG&E RESPECTIVELY BY LATE OF 2013. IN TOTAL, THE PROJECT WILL POWER MORE THAN 140,000 HOMES AND BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. IVANPAH WILL HELP ITS CUSTOMERS PG&E AND SCE MEET THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA’S RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD (RPS) REQUIREMENTS, LEGISLATION REQUIRING EACH INVESTOR-OWNED UTILITY TO PROCURE 33 PERCENT OF ITS ENERGY PORTFOLIO FROM RENEWABLE RESOURCES BY 2020. TECHNOLOGY PROVIDED BY BRIGHTSOURCE ENERGY IVANPAH WILL EMPLOY BRIGHTSOURCE’S POWER TOWER SOLAR THERMAL TECHNOLOGY, WHICH GENERATES POWER THE SAME WAY AS TRADITIONAL POWER PLANTS – BY CREATING HIGH TEMPERATURE STEAM TO TURN A TURBINE. HOWEVER, INSTEAD OF USING FOSSIL FUELS OR NUCLEAR POWER TO CREATE THE STEAM, BRIGHTSOURCE USES THE SUN’S ENERGY. BRIGHTSOURCE’S SYSTEM USES A STATE-OF-THE-ART FIELD OF SOFTWARE-CONTROLLED MIRRORS, CALLED HELIOSTATS, TO REFLECT THE SUN’S ENERGY TO A BOILER ATOP A TOWER TO PRODUCE THE HIGH TEMPERATURE AND HIGH-PRESSURE STEAM. THE STEAM CAN THEN BE INTEGRATED WITH CONVENTIONAL POWER PLANT COMPONENTS TO PRODUCE PREDICTABLE, RELIABLE AND COST-COMPETITIVE CLEAN ENERGY. CREATING JOBS LOCALLY AND NATIONALLY THE $2.2 BILLION PROJECT IS AN INVESTMENT INTO AMERICA’S FUTURE WITH SUBSTANTIAL INDIRECT ECONOMIC BENEFITS LOCALLY AND ACROSS THE NATION. TO DATE, THE PROJECT’S ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR BECHTEL HAS RETAINED OVER 2,000 CONSTRUCTION WORKERS TO BUILD THE PLANT, IN ADDITION TO THE MORE THAN 100 ENGINEERING AND SUPPORT STAFF ON SITE. BECHTEL SIGNED A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT WITH THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA (SBCTC) AND THE BUILDING & CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL OF SAN BERNARDINO AND RIVERSIDE COUNTIES TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA‘S LOCAL WORKFORCE BENEFITS FROM THE PROJECT. THE PROJECT REQUIRES THE WORK OF SKILLED CRAFT WORKERS AND ENGINEERS FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF TRADES AND DISCIPLINES, INCLUDING PIPEFITTERS, MILLWRIGHTS, CARPENTERS, ELECTRICIANS, LABORERS AND CIVIL ENGINEERS. THE PROJECT WILL PROVIDE $400 MILLION IN LOCAL AND STATE TAX REVENUES, AND PRODUCE $650 MILLION IN WAGES, OVER ITS FIRST 30-YEAR LIFE. THE MAJORITY OF THE PROJECT’S SUPPLY CHAIN IS BEING SOURCED DOMESTICALLY ACROSS 17 U.S. STATES, DRIVING INVESTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND CREATING ADDITIONAL JOBS IN OTHER AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. CONSTRUCTION PROGRESS AT IVANPAH “THE SCALE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE IVANPAH PROJECT PRESENTED FIRST-OF-A-KIND CONSTRUCTION CHALLENGES THAT REQUIRED INNOVATIVE THINKING AND EXECUTION AT EVERY LEVEL,” SAID JIM IVANY, PRESIDENT OF BECHTEL’S RENEWABLE POWER BUSINESS. “WE CREATED LEAN APPROACHES TO MULTIPLE PHASES OF THE PROJECT, INCLUDING HELIOSTAT ASSEMBLY INSTALLATION AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROJECT’S STEEL TOWERS, EACH TOPPED WITH 2,200-TON SOLAR RECEIVER STEAM GENERATORS. THE PROCESSES WE DEVELOPED ENABLED THE TEAM TO SUCCESSFULLY ADVANCE THE PROJECT TO SUPPORT ELECTRICITY GENERATION IN 2013.” THE THREE-UNIT IVANPAH SEGS COMMENCED CONSTRUCTION IN OCTOBER 2010 AND IS HALFWAY COMPLETE. IN THE POWER BLOCK AREA, HOME TO THE MAJOR POWER PLANT EQUIPMENT, WORKERS HAVE ERECTED THREE STEEL TOWER STRUCTURES TO SUPPORT THE BOILERS WHICH EXTEND TO A HEIGHT OF 459 FEET, WELDING INTERCONNECTING PIPE INSIDE THE BOILER AND INSTALLING POWER PLANT EQUIPMENT. IN THE SOLAR FIELD, WORKERS ARE INSTALLING THE PROJECT’S 173,000 PYLONS AND HELIOSTATS, WHICH ARE ASSEMBLED ON-SITE AT A RATE OF 500 EACH DAY. TO DATE, WORKERS HAVE INSTALLED MORE THAN 100,000 STEEL PYLONS AND NEARLY 50,000 HELIOSTATS. FOR MORE DETAILS ON CONSTRUCTION PROGRESS, PLEASE SEE OUR BI-MONTHLY UPDATE FROM IVANPAH. NET BENEFIT TO TAXPAYERS FINANCING OF THIS PROJECT WAS FACILITATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY’S 1703 LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM. THE PROJECT'S POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT, AS WELL AS ITS AGGRESSIVE MANAGEMENT OF COST AND SCHEDULE, ASSURE THAT THE LOAN WILL BE PAID BACK, WITH INTEREST, TO THE BENEFIT OF TAXPAYERS. AN ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE PROJECT THE IVANPAH PROJECT WILL REDUCE CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) EMISSIONS BY MORE THAN 400,000 TONS ANNUALLY, WHICH IS THE EQUIVALENT OF TAKING MORE THAN 70,000 CARS OFF THE ROAD. BRIGHTSOURCE’S SYSTEM IS ALSO DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE IMPACTS ON THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION TO BEING ONE OF THE MOST LAND-EFFICIENT RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES, BRIGHTSOURCE’S LOW IMPACT HELIOSTAT LAYOUT IS FLEXIBLE, ALLOWING THE SOLAR FIELD TO BE BUILT AROUND THE NATURAL CONTOURS OF THE LAND AND AVOID AREAS OF SENSITIVE VEGETATION. AND IN ORDER TO CONSERVE SCARCE WATER RESOURCES, THE TECHNOLOGY EMPLOYS AN AIR-COOLING SYSTEM TO CONVERT THE STEAM BACK INTO WATER IN A CLOSED-LOOP CYCLE. BY USING AN AIR-COOLED CONDENSER, BRIGHTSOURCE’S TECHNOLOGY USES MORE THAN 90 PERCENT LESS WATER THAN OLDER TECHNOLOGY PARABOLIC TROUGH PLANTS WITH WET COOLING. ABOUT BRIGHTSOURCE ENERGY, INC.
