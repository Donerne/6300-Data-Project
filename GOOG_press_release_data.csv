AND ENCOURAGES INVESTORS TO CONTACT THE FIRM","NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BRAGAR EAGEL & SQUIRE, P.C., A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS LAW FIRM, REMINDS INVESTORS THAT A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT HAS BEEN FILED AGAINST ALPHABET INC. (“ALPHABET” OR THE “COMPANY”) (NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA ON BEHALF OF ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES WHO PURCHASED OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRED ALPHABET SECURITIES BETWEEN FEBRUARY 4, 2020 AND JANUARY 23, 2023, BOTH DATES INCLUSIVE (THE “CLASS PERIOD”). INVESTORS HAVE UNTIL MAY 15, 2023 TO APPLY TO THE COURT TO BE APPOINTED AS LEAD PLAINTIFF IN THE LAWSUIT. CLICK HERE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ACTION. ALPHABET IS A MULTINATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CONGLOMERATE HOLDING COMPANY. IT WAS CREATED THROUGH A RESTRUCTURING OF GOOGLE INC. IN OCTOBER 2015, AT WHICH POINT ALPHABET BECAME THE PARENT COMPANY OF GOOGLE AND SEVERAL FORMER GOOGLE SUBSIDIARIES. ALPHABET IS HEADQUARTERED IN MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA AND INCORPORATED IN DELAWARE. THE COMPANY’S CLASS A AND CLASS C SHARES TRADE ON THE NASDAQ UNDER THE TICKER SYMBOLS “GOOGL” AND “GOOG,” RESPECTIVELY. ALPHABET’S SUBSIDIARY GOOGLE IS A DOMINANT PLAYER IN THE FIELD OF DIGITAL ADVERTISING, TO THE EXTENT THAT IT CONTROLS THE DIGITAL TOOLS THAT EVERY MAJOR WEBSITE PUBLISHER USES TO SELL ADVERTISING SPACE ON THEIR WEBSITES. IN RECENT YEARS, GOOGLE’S DOMINANCE IN THIS INDUSTRY HAS DRAWN REGULATORY SCRUTINY. IN JULY 2018, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION (“EC”) FINED GOOGLE €2.42 BILLION FOR PROMOTING ITS OWN SHOPPING COMPARISON SERVICE AT THE TOP OF ITS SEARCH RESULTS. LESS THAN A YEAR LATER, IN MARCH 2019, THE EC FINED GOOGLE €1.49 BILLION FOR PREVENTING RIVALS FROM BEING ABLE TO “COMPETE AND INNOVATE FAIRLY” IN THE ONLINE ADVERTISING MARKET. IN JUNE 2019, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (“DOJ”) REPORTED THAT IT WOULD INVESTIGATE GOOGLE FOR ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS. THEN, IN OCTOBER 2020, THE DOJ FILED AN ANTITRUST LAWSUIT AGAINST GOOGLE, ALLEGING THAT IT HAD ABUSED A MONOPOLY POSITION IN THE SEARCH AND SEARCH ADVERTISING MARKETS. THROUGHOUT THE CLASS PERIOD, DEFENDANTS MADE MATERIALLY FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS REGARDING THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS, OPERATIONS, AND COMPLIANCE POLICIES. SPECIFICALLY, DEFENDANTS MADE FALSE AND/OR MISLEADING STATEMENTS AND/OR FAILED TO DISCLOSE THAT: (I) ALPHABET USED ITS DOMINANCE IN THE FIELD OF DIGITAL ADVERTISING TO DISADVANTAGE WEBSITE PUBLISHERS AND ADVERTISERS WHO USED COMPETING ADVERTISING PRODUCTS; (II) THE FOREGOING CONDUCT WAS ANTICOMPETITIVE IN NATURE AND LIKELY TO DRAW SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY SCRUTINY; (III) ALPHABET’S REVENUES WERE UNSUSTAINABLE TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY WERE THE PRODUCT OF SAID ANTICOMPETITIVE CONDUCT; (IV) ALPHABET’S CONDUCT, ONCE REVEALED, WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY’S REPUTATION AND EXPOSE IT TO A HEIGHTENED RISK OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT ACTION; AND (V) AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY’S PUBLIC STATEMENTS WERE MATERIALLY FALSE AND MISLEADING AT ALL RELEVANT TIMES. ON JANUARY 24, 2023, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND EIGHT STATES FILED AN ANTITRUST LAWSUIT AGAINST ALPHABET’S GOOGLE SUBSIDIARY, ACCUSING GOOGLE OF ILLEGALLY ABUSING ITS DOMINANCE IN DIGITAL ADVERTISING AND VIOLATING THE SHERMAN ANTITRUST ACT. THE LAWSUIT ALLEGES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT “GOOGLE ABUSES ITS MONOPOLY POWER TO DISADVANTAGE WEBSITE PUBLISHERS AND ADVERTISERS WHO DARE TO USE COMPETING AD TECH PRODUCTS IN A SEARCH FOR HIGHER QUALITY, OR LOWER COST, MATCHES.” ON THIS NEWS, ALPHABET’S CLASS A SHARES FELL $2.09 PER SHARE, OR 2.09%, TO CLOSE AT $97.70 PER SHARE, WHILE ITS CLASS C SHARES FELL $2.00 PER SHARE, OR 1.98%, TO CLOSE AT $99.21 PER SHARE, ON JANUARY 24, 2023. AS A RESULT OF DEFENDANTS’ WRONGFUL ACTS AND OMISSIONS, AND THE PRECIPITOUS DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANY’S SECURITIES, PLAINTIFF AND OTHER CLASS MEMBERS HAVE SUFFERED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES AND DAMAGES.

ALPHABET IS A MULTINATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CONGLOMERATE HOLDING COMPANY. IT WAS CREATED THROUGH A RESTRUCTURING OF GOOGLE INC. IN OCTOBER 2015, AT WHICH POINT ALPHABET BECAME THE PARENT COMPANY OF GOOGLE AND SEVERAL FORMER GOOGLE SUBSIDIARIES. ALPHABET IS HEADQUARTERED IN MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA AND INCORPORATED IN DELAWARE. THE COMPANY’S CLASS A AND CLASS C SHARES TRADE ON THE NASDAQ UNDER THE TICKER SYMBOLS “GOOGL” AND “GOOG,” RESPECTIVELY. ALPHABET’S SUBSIDIARY GOOGLE IS A DOMINANT PLAYER IN THE FIELD OF DIGITAL ADVERTISING, TO THE EXTENT THAT IT CONTROLS THE DIGITAL TOOLS THAT EVERY MAJOR WEBSITE PUBLISHER USES TO SELL ADVERTISING SPACE ON THEIR WEBSITES. IN RECENT YEARS, GOOGLE’S DOMINANCE IN THIS INDUSTRY HAS DRAWN REGULATORY SCRUTINY. IN JULY 2018, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION (“EC”) FINED GOOGLE €2.42 BILLION FOR PROMOTING ITS OWN SHOPPING COMPARISON SERVICE AT THE TOP OF ITS SEARCH RESULTS. LESS THAN A YEAR LATER, IN MARCH 2019, THE EC FINED GOOGLE €1.49 BILLION FOR PREVENTING RIVALS FROM BEING ABLE TO “COMPETE AND INNOVATE FAIRLY” IN THE ONLINE ADVERTISING MARKET. IN JUNE 2019, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (“DOJ”) REPORTED THAT IT WOULD INVESTIGATE GOOGLE FOR ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS. THEN, IN OCTOBER 2020, THE DOJ FILED AN ANTITRUST LAWSUIT AGAINST GOOGLE, ALLEGING THAT IT HAD ABUSED A MONOPOLY POSITION IN THE SEARCH AND SEARCH ADVERTISING MARKETS. THROUGHOUT THE CLASS PERIOD, DEFENDANTS MADE MATERIALLY FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS REGARDING THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS, OPERATIONS, AND COMPLIANCE POLICIES.

04-11-2014,レノボがグーグルからのモトローラ・モビリティの買収を完了,米ノースカロライナ州リサーチ・トライアングル・パーク & カリフォルニア州マウンテンビュー--(BUSINESS WIRE)--（ビジネスワイヤ） -- レノボ（HKSE：0992）（PINK SHEETS：LNVGY）とグーグル（NASDAQ：GOOG）は本日、レノボがグーグルからのモトローラ・モビリティの買収を完了させたと発表しました。 モトローラ・ブランド、そしてMOTO X、MOTO G、MOTO E、DROIDTMシリーズといったモトローラの革新的なスマートフォンのポートフォリオ、さらにモトローラの将来的な製品ロードマップを買収したことで、レノボは世界第3位のスマートフォンメーカーの地位につくことになります。 レノボはモトローラを完全所有子会社として運営します。モトローラの本社は、引き続きシカゴに置きます。買収完了に伴い、レノボは新たな製品ポートフォリオと共に、米国にいる約2800人を含め、世界各地の約3500人の従業員を迎え入れます。これらの従業員は、モトローラの卓越したデバイスのデザイン・設計・販売・サポートを担当します。 レノボの楊元慶会長兼最高経営責任者（CEO）は、次のように述べています。「私たちは本日、レノボとモトローラにとって歴史的なマイルストーンを達成しました。両社は力を合わせ、世界のスマートフォン市場で競い、成長し、勝ち抜く準備が整っています。強固なナンバー3としての地位を築き、スマートフォン市場の上位2社を猛追する信頼できる有力企業となることで、これまで市場が求めていたもの、すなわち選択肢、競争、革新のひらめきを提供します。両社の提携は、もとより理想的な組み合わせでした。レノボは明確な戦略と素晴らしい世界的規模、そして実証済みの卓越した事業能力を持っています。モトローラは米国やその他の成熟市場で確たるプレゼンスがあり、通信キャリアと構築してきたよい関係、象徴的なブランド、強力なIPポートフォリオ、極めて有能なチームを抱えています。勝利が約束された、申し分のない組み合わせです。」 グーグルのラリー・ペイジCEOは、次のように語っています。「モトローラを安心してレノボに任せることができるのは、同社が素晴らしいデバイスの開発に全力で取り組んでいるからです。」 レノボのモバイル事業グループ担当エグゼクティブバイスプレジデントのリュー・ジュン氏が、モトローラ取締役会議長を務めます。モトローラでの経験が豊富なベテランのリック・オステーロー氏は、モトローラ社長兼最高執行責任者（COO）に留任します。 リュー・ジュン氏は、次のように語っています。「モトローラはすでに市場で力強い勢いを得ており、同社の最近の業績は、消費者がデザインとシンプルさが光る同社の優れた製品に大きな期待を寄せていることを示しています。両社が補完的な強みを持ち寄ることで、今年はスマートフォンとタブレットを含め、1億台以上のモバイル機器を販売できる見通しです。そのために中国市場におけるレノボ・ブランドの主導的立場、両社の新興市場での勢い、そしてモトローラの米国などの成熟市場での強固な足場を活用します。」 すでにモトローラは、大成功を収めた新製品のリリースや画期的な革新により、市場で勢いを増しており、堅調に成長しています。スマートフォン以外にも、MOTO 360ウォッチが消費者の関心を集めており、モトローラはモバイル機器の新興分野に事業を拡大している企業としても、地位を確立しています。前述の通り、レノボは4～6四半期の間にモトローラの事業を黒字に転換させる予定です。 グーグルはモトローラ・モビリティの特許ポートフォリオの大半を引き続き所有し、モトローラはこの充実した特許ポートフォリオやその他の知的財産のライセンス供与を受けます。モトローラは2000件以上の特許資産、多数の特許クロスライセンス契約、そしてモトローラ・モビリティのブランドと商標ポートフォリオを保持します。 買収総額は約29億1000万米ドル（買収完了後に調整）で、これには現金約6億6000万米ドルと、新たに発行されたレノボの株式5億1910万7215株が含まれます。買収完了時にグーグルに譲渡されたレノボの株式は、時価総額7億5000万米ドルで、レノボの発行済み株式の約4.7パーセントに相当します。レノボは残15億米ドルを3年満期の約束手形でグーグルに支払います。レノボはそのほか、買収完了時にモトローラが保有していた現金および運転資金として、約2億2800万米ドルをグーグルに支払っています。 この買収取引は米国、中国、EU、ブラジル、メキシコの競争当局が定めるすべての規制要件と慣習的な取引完了条件を満たしており、対米外国投資委員会（CFIUS）からも認可を得ています。レノボがCFIUSから米国事業の買収で認可を受けたのは、2005年以来、本件で5件目になります。 レノボについて レノボ（HKSE：992）（ADR：LNVGY）はフォーチュン・グローバル500社に選ばれている390億ドル規模のリーダー企業として、消費者、商用、エンターテインメント向けの革新的技術を提供しています。当社の高品質でセキュアな製品とサービスのポートフォリオには、PC（名高いTHINKブランドやマルチモードのYOGAブランド他）、ワークステーション、サーバー、ストレージ、スマートTV、そしてスマートフォン（モトローラ・ブランドを含む）、タブレット、アプリを含むモバイル製品ファミリーを網羅しています。リンクトイン、フェイスブック、ツイッター（@LENOVO）で当社をフォローするか、WWW.LENOVO.COMをご覧ください。 グーグルについて グーグルは世界的な技術リーダー企業として、人々と情報のつながり方を向上させることに傾注しています。グーグルがウェブ検索とウェブ広告の革新に努めていることで、同社のウェブサイトは最高のインターネット資産となり、同社のブランドは世界で最高レベルの認知度を誇っています。 *DROIDはLUCASFILM LTD.と関連企業の商標です。ライセンスに基づき利用しています 詳細情報 プレスキットはこちらをご覧ください：HTTP://NEWS.LENOVO.COM/MOTOROLAACQUISITION 写真とマルチメディア・ギャラリーはこちらをご覧ください：HTTP://WWW.BUSINESSWIRE.COM/MULTIMEDIA/HOME/20141030005409/JA/ 本記者発表文の公式バージョンはオリジナル言語版です。翻訳言語版は、読者の便宜を図る目的で提供されたものであり、法的効力を持ちません。翻訳言語版を資料としてご利用になる際には、法的効力を有する唯一のバージョンであるオリジナル言語版と照らし合わせて頂くようお願い致します。

THE LAWSUIT, FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, ALLEGES THAT GOOGLE ABRUPTLY CANCELS WEBSITE OWNERS’ ADSENSE ACCOUNTS OFTEN WITHOUT EXPLANATION SHORTLY BEFORE PAYMENTS ARE DUE, AND REFUSES TO PAY FOR THE ADS THAT RAN PRIOR TO THE CANCELATION. “THIS WRONGFUL PRACTICE HAS SPARKED NUMEROUS BITTER COMPLAINTS FROM WEBSITE OWNERS ACROSS THE WEB, WITH SOME REPORTING LOSSES REACHING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A POP,” SAID STEVE BERMAN, ATTORNEY REPRESENTING CONSUMERS AND FOUNDING PARTNER OF HAGENS BERMAN. “WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE TRUE FROM OUR RESEARCH IS THAT GOOGLE’S PRACTICE IS LIKELY HURTING THOUSANDS OF WEBSITE OWNERS AND OPERATORS WHO FEEL THEY HAVE NO WAY TO FIGHT A GIANT COMPANY LIKE GOOGLE.” ACCORDING TO THE SUIT, GOOGLE’S POPULAR ADSENSE PROGRAM TRANSLATES ANNUALLY TO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS PAYABLE TO WEBSITE OPERATORS THAT HOST ITS ADS VIA ADSENSE. GOOGLE’S ADSENSE ADVERTISING PROGRAM INDUCES WEBSITE OPERATORS TO HOST SPACE FOR ADS ON THEIR WEBSITES. EACH TIME A VISITOR TO THE WEBSITE INTERACTS WITH THE AD, THE AD PUBLISHER WHO HOSTS THE AD EARNS PAYMENT. THE COMPLAINT CLAIMS THAT THE CONTRACTS AND TERMS OF SERVICE GOOGLE REQUIRES WEB PUBLISHERS TO SIGN ARE UNCONSCIONABLY ONE-SIDED, GIVING GOOGLE FREE REIGN TO EMBARK ON WHAT THE SUIT CLAIMS ARE ACTIONS DEVOID OF GOOD FAITH OR FAIR DEALING. “WE HAVE HEARD FROM WEB PUBLISHERS WHO TELL US THE SAME THING: GOOGLE CUTS THEM OFF RIGHT BEFORE A PAYMENT IS DUE, AND STONEWALLS THEM WHEN THEY OBJECT,” BERMAN SAID. “GOOGLE’S COMPANY MOTTO IS ‘DON’T BE EVIL.’ KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW, I THINK THEY HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO BE TRUE TO THAT GOAL.” THE COMPLAINT STATES, “GIVEN GOOGLE’S CONTRACTUAL TERMS PURPORTEDLY PERMITTING IT TO WITHHOLD PAYMENT TO PUBLISHERS WITH DISABLED ACCOUNTS, AND IN LIGHT OF THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PLAINTIFF IN SEEING THIS POLICY ACTUALLY EFFECTED, THE TOTAL OF EARNED FUNDS THAT GOOGLE HAS REFUSED TO PAY ITS ADSENSE PUBLISHERS COULD BE ENORMOUS.” THE LAWSUIT CLAIMS GOOGLE IS IN VIOLATION OF CONTRACTS WITH USERS AND IN VIOLATION OF THE IMPLIED COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING, UNJUST ENRICHMENT, AND VIOLATION OF THE CALIFORNIA UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW. THE NAMED PLAINTIFF, FREE RANGE CONTENT, INC., IS A CALIFORNIA CORPORATION THAT OWNS AND OPERATES REPOST.US. FREE RANGE CONTENT FIRST NOTICED A SPIKE IN ADSENSE EARNINGS IN FEB. 2014. AT THE END OF FEB. 2014, GOOGLE ISSUED A REPORT STATING THAT THE PLAINTIFF’S ESTIMATED EARNINGS FOR THE COVERED PERIOD WERE OVER $40,000 – A NUMBER THAT SEEMED FAR TOO HIGH. THEN ON MARCH 4, 2014—TWO DAYS BEFORE A SCHEDULED MARCH 6, 2014 CALL WITH AN ADSENSE REPRESENTATIVE WAS SLATED TO OCCUR—THE PLAINTIFF RECEIVED WORD FROM THE ADSENSE PROGRAM THAT GOOGLE HAD DISABLED ITS ACCOUNT. THE LAWSUIT SEEKS DAMAGES FOR ALL U.S. GOOGLE ADSENSE PUBLISHERS WHOSE ADSENSE ACCOUNT WAS DISABLED OR TERMINATED, AND WHOSE LAST ADSENSE PROGRAM PAYMENT WAS WITHHELD PERMANENTLY BY GOOGLE. CONCERNED CONSUMERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO CONTACT A HAGENS BERMAN ATTORNEY BY EMAILING GOOGLEADSENSE@HBSSLAW.COM OR CALLING (206) 623-7292.

01-05-2014,"HAGENS BERMAN ANNOUNCES NATIONWIDE ANTITRUST CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT 
      AGAINST GOOGLE","SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--HAGENS BERMAN, A CONSUMER RIGHTS CLASS-ACTION LAW FIRM, TODAY ANNOUNCED IT HAS FILED A NATIONWIDE ANTITRUST CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST GOOGLE (NASDAQ:GOOG) CLAIMING THE SEARCH ENGINE GIANT ILLEGALLY MONOPOLIZED, AND FINANCIALLY AND CREATIVELY STAGNATED THE AMERICAN MARKET OF INTERNET AND MOBILE SEARCH. THE LAWSUIT, FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, ALLEGES THAT GOOGLE’S MONOPOLY OF THESE MARKETS STEMS FROM THE COMPANY’S PURCHASING OF ANDROID MOBILE OPERATING SYSTEM (ANDROID OS) TO MAINTAIN AND EXPAND ITS MONOPOLY BY PRE-LOADING ITS OWN SUITE OF APPLICATIONS ONTO THE DEVICES BY WAY OF SECRET MOBILE APPLICATION DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS (MADA). ACCORDING TO THE SUIT, THESE AGREEMENTS WERE HIDDEN AND MARKED TO BE VIEWED ONLY BY ATTORNEYS. ACCORDING TO THE SUIT, GOOGLE’S ROLE IN PLACING THIS SUITE OF APPS, INCLUDING GOOGLE PLAY, AND YOUTUBE, AMONG OTHERS, HAS HAMPERED THE MARKET AND KEPT THE PRICE OF DEVICES MADE BY COMPETING DEVICE MANUFACTURES LIKE SAMSUNG AND HTC ARTIFICIALLY HIGH. “IT’S CLEAR THAT GOOGLE HAS NOT ACHIEVED THIS MONOPOLY THROUGH OFFERING A BETTER SEARCH ENGINE, BUT THROUGH ITS STRATEGIC, ANTI-COMPETITIVE PLACEMENT, AND IT DOESN’T TAKE A FORENSIC ECONOMIST TO SEE THAT THIS IS EVIDENCE OF MARKET MANIPULATION,” SAID STEVE BERMAN, ATTORNEY REPRESENTING CONSUMERS AND FOUNDING PARTNER OF HAGENS BERMAN. “SIMPLY PUT, THERE IS NO LAWFUL, PRO-COMPETITIVE REASON FOR GOOGLE TO CONDITION LICENSES TO PRE-LOAD POPULAR GOOGLE APPS LIKE THIS.” THE COMPLAINT CLAIMS THAT IF DEVICE MANUFACTURERS BOUND BY GOOGLE’S DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS WERE FREE TO CHOOSE A DEFAULT SEARCH ENGINE OTHER THAN GOOGLE, THE OVERALL QUALITY OF INTERNET SEARCH WOULD IMPROVE. “THE MORE USE AN INTERNET OR MOBILE SEARCH ENGINE GETS, THE BETTER IT PERFORMS BASED ON THAT USE,” BERMAN SAID. “INSTEAD OF FINDING A WAY TO LEGITIMATELY OUT-COMPETE OTHER INTERNET AND MOBILE SEARCH PROVIDERS, THEY INSTEAD DECIDED TO CHOKE OFF COMPETITION THROUGH THIS CYNICAL, ANTI-CONSUMER SCHEME.” THE COMPLAINT NOTES THAT GOOGLE’S MONOPOLY NOT ONLY SUPPRESSES ITS COMPETITION BUT ALSO KEEPS THE COMPANY ITSELF FROM IMPROVING. “THIS COMES DOWN TO A COMBINATION OF GOOGLE’S POWER IN THE U.S. GENERAL MOBILE SEARCH MARKET AND THEIR POWER IN THE REALM OF TABLET AND SMARTPHONE MANUFACTURERS,” BERMAN SAID. “AS A RESULT OF THE PRICING CONSPIRACY, EVERYONE LOSES. GOOGLE AND ITS COMPETITORS FACE AN UNCOMPETITIVE, STAGNANT MARKET, AND CONSUMERS ARE FORCED INTO ONE OPTION.” ACCORDING TO THE LAWSUIT, GOOGLE’S MADAS ARE CONTRACTS IN RESTRAINT OF TRADE THAT ARE DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN AND EXTEND ITS MONOPOLIES IN GENERAL SEARCH AND HANDHELD GENERAL SEARCH. THE LAWSUIT CLAIMS GOOGLE IS IN VIOLATION OF A VARIETY OF FEDERAL AND STATE ANTITRUST LAWS, INCLUDING THE SHERMAN ACT, THE CLAYTON ANTITRUST ACT, CALIFORNIA CARTWRIGHT ACT AND CALIFORNIA UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW. THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS INCLUDE GARY FEITELSON, A RESIDENT OF LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY AND OWNER OF AN HTC EVO 3D MOBILE PHONE, AND DANIEL MCKEE, A RESIDENT OF DES MOINES, IOWA AND OWNER OF A SAMSUNG GALAXY S III MOBILE PHONE. ACCORDING TO THE COMPLAINT, IN BOTH SITUATIONS, THE OWNERS’ PHONES SHOULD HAVE COST LESS AND HAD BETTER SEARCH CAPABILITIES AS THE RESULT OF COMPETITION THAT WOULD HAVE ENSUED, HAD GOOGLE’S MADA RESTRAINTS NOT EXISTED. THE LAWSUIT SEEKS TO REPRESENT ALL U.S. PURCHASERS OF ANY ANDROID OS MOBILE TELEPHONE OR TABLET AS TO WHICH GOOGLE AND THE MANUFACTURER OF SUCH DEVICE HAS ENTERED INTO A CONTRACT OR CONTRACTS, INCLUDING THE MADA, BY WHICH GOOGLE HAS CONDITIONED THE RIGHT TO PRE-LOAD ANY APPLICATION FROM A SUITE OF GOOGLE APPLICATIONS ON TO MANUFACTURER’S MANDATORY ACCEPTANCE. THE LAWSUIT SEEKS DAMAGES FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PURCHASED THESE DEVICES AT AN ARTIFICIALLY HIGH PRICE DUE TO GOOGLE’S ALLEGED PRICE-FIXING, ANTICOMPETITIVE RESTRICTIONS. CONCERNED CONSUMERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO CONTACT A HAGENS BERMAN ATTORNEY BY EMAILING GOOGLE@HBSSLAW.COM OR CALLING (206) 623-7292.

07-08-2012,"IVANPAH SOLAR PROJECT REACHES HALFWAY MARK AND PEAK OF CONSTRUCTION 
      EMPLOYMENT","IVANPAH, CALIF.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NRG ENERGY, GOOGLE, BRIGHTSOURCE ENERGY AND CONSTRUCTION PARTNER BECHTEL ANNOUNCED THAT THE IVANPAH SOLAR ELECTRIC GENERATING SYSTEM (IVANPAH SEGS) HAS REACHED THE HALFWAY MARK OF CONSTRUCTION ON THE WORLD’S LARGEST SOLAR THERMAL PROJECT. IVANPAH HAS ALSO REACHED ITS PEAK CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE, WITH MORE THAN 2,100 CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND PROJECT SUPPORT STAFF ON-SITE. THE $2.2 BILLION PROJECT IS ON-TRACK TO BE COMPLETE IN 2013. “LARGE-SCALE SOLAR PROJECTS LIKE IVANPAH CREATE THOUSANDS OF CONSTRUCTION JOBS AND PROVIDE CLEAN, RENEWABLE POWER TO HELP MEET STATE RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS,” SAID TOM DOYLE, CEO OF NRG SOLAR. “WE BELIEVE THAT ENCOURAGING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN OUR DOMESTIC CLEAN ENERGY INDUSTRY THROUGH SUCCESSFUL PROJECTS LIKE IVANPAH ULTIMATELY WILL PAY DIVIDENDS BY HELPING TO SECURE OUR COUNTRY’S ECONOMIC FUTURE.” “IVANPAH IS AN ICONIC INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT THAT WILL SET THE COURSE FOR THE FUTURE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY IN THE US AND AROUND THE WORLD,” SAID JOHN WOOLARD, PRESIDENT & CEO, BRIGHTSOURCE ENERGY. “WE ARE TREMENDOUSLY PROUD OF THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS BEING MADE TOWARDS IVANPAH’S COMPLETION, AND LOOK FORWARD TO POWERING CALIFORNIA’S HOMES AND BUSINESSES WITH CLEAN AND RELIABLE ELECTRICITY IN THE COMING YEAR.” “IVANPAH WILL BE THE LARGEST PROJECT IN THE WORLD TO USE THIS POTENTIALLY TRANSFORMATIVE SOLAR TECHNOLOGY,” SAID RICK NEEDHAM, DIRECTOR OF ENERGY & SUSTAINABILITY FOR GOOGLE. “WE HOPE THAT OUR SUPPORT SPURS FURTHER INVESTMENT TO DEPLOY INNOVATIVE, SCALABLE RENEWABLE ENERGY SOLUTIONS AROUND THE WORLD.” ABOUT THE IVANPAH PROJECT THE 370 (NET) MEGAWATT IVANPAH SOLAR POWER FACILITY IS LOCATED ON APPROXIMATELY 3,500 ACRES OF FEDERAL LAND IN CALIFORNIA’S MOJAVE DESERT MANAGED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR‘S BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT (BLM). THE THREE INDIVIDUAL POWER PLANTS AT IVANPAH WILL FEATURE BRIGHTSOURCE ENERGY’S SOLAR THERMAL POWER TOWER TECHNOLOGY TO PRODUCE CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY FROM THE SUN. WHEN COMPLETED IN 2013, THE FACILITY WILL NEARLY DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF SOLAR THERMAL ELECTRICITY PRODUCED IN THE US. POWER GENERATED FROM THE PLANTS WILL BE SOLD UNDER SEPARATE CONTRACTS WITH PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC (PG&E) AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON (SCE). THE FIRST UNIT WILL BEGIN SUPPLYING POWER TO PG&E IN MID 2013, WITH UNITS TWO AND THREE DELIVERING POWER TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND PG&E RESPECTIVELY BY LATE OF 2013. IN TOTAL, THE PROJECT WILL POWER MORE THAN 140,000 HOMES AND BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. IVANPAH WILL HELP ITS CUSTOMERS PG&E AND SCE MEET THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA’S RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD (RPS) REQUIREMENTS, LEGISLATION REQUIRING EACH INVESTOR-OWNED UTILITY TO PROCURE 33 PERCENT OF ITS ENERGY PORTFOLIO FROM RENEWABLE RESOURCES BY 2020. TECHNOLOGY PROVIDED BY BRIGHTSOURCE ENERGY IVANPAH WILL EMPLOY BRIGHTSOURCE’S POWER TOWER SOLAR THERMAL TECHNOLOGY, WHICH GENERATES POWER THE SAME WAY AS TRADITIONAL POWER PLANTS – BY CREATING HIGH TEMPERATURE STEAM TO TURN A TURBINE. HOWEVER, INSTEAD OF USING FOSSIL FUELS OR NUCLEAR POWER TO CREATE THE STEAM, BRIGHTSOURCE USES THE SUN’S ENERGY. BRIGHTSOURCE’S SYSTEM USES A STATE-OF-THE-ART FIELD OF SOFTWARE-CONTROLLED MIRRORS, CALLED HELIOSTATS, TO REFLECT THE SUN’S ENERGY TO A BOILER ATOP A TOWER TO PRODUCE THE HIGH TEMPERATURE AND HIGH-PRESSURE STEAM. THE STEAM CAN THEN BE INTEGRATED WITH CONVENTIONAL POWER PLANT COMPONENTS TO PRODUCE PREDICTABLE, RELIABLE AND COST-COMPETITIVE CLEAN ENERGY. CREATING JOBS LOCALLY AND NATIONALLY THE $2.2 BILLION PROJECT IS AN INVESTMENT INTO AMERICA’S FUTURE WITH SUBSTANTIAL INDIRECT ECONOMIC BENEFITS LOCALLY AND ACROSS THE NATION. TO DATE, THE PROJECT’S ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR BECHTEL HAS RETAINED OVER 2,000 CONSTRUCTION WORKERS TO BUILD THE PLANT, IN ADDITION TO THE MORE THAN 100 ENGINEERING AND SUPPORT STAFF ON SITE. BECHTEL SIGNED A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT WITH THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA (SBCTC) AND THE BUILDING & CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL OF SAN BERNARDINO AND RIVERSIDE COUNTIES TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA‘S LOCAL WORKFORCE BENEFITS FROM THE PROJECT. THE PROJECT REQUIRES THE WORK OF SKILLED CRAFT WORKERS AND ENGINEERS FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF TRADES AND DISCIPLINES, INCLUDING PIPEFITTERS, MILLWRIGHTS, CARPENTERS, ELECTRICIANS, LABORERS AND CIVIL ENGINEERS. THE PROJECT WILL PROVIDE $400 MILLION IN LOCAL AND STATE TAX REVENUES, AND PRODUCE $650 MILLION IN WAGES, OVER ITS FIRST 30-YEAR LIFE. THE MAJORITY OF THE PROJECT’S SUPPLY CHAIN IS BEING SOURCED DOMESTICALLY ACROSS 17 U.S. STATES, DRIVING INVESTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND CREATING ADDITIONAL JOBS IN OTHER AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. CONSTRUCTION PROGRESS AT IVANPAH “THE SCALE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE IVANPAH PROJECT PRESENTED FIRST-OF-A-KIND CONSTRUCTION CHALLENGES THAT REQUIRED INNOVATIVE THINKING AND EXECUTION AT EVERY LEVEL,” SAID JIM IVANY, PRESIDENT OF BECHTEL’S RENEWABLE POWER BUSINESS. “WE CREATED LEAN APPROACHES TO MULTIPLE PHASES OF THE PROJECT, INCLUDING HELIOSTAT ASSEMBLY INSTALLATION AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROJECT’S STEEL TOWERS, EACH TOPPED WITH 2,200-TON SOLAR RECEIVER STEAM GENERATORS. THE PROCESSES WE DEVELOPED ENABLED THE TEAM TO SUCCESSFULLY ADVANCE THE PROJECT TO SUPPORT ELECTRICITY GENERATION IN 2013.” THE THREE-UNIT IVANPAH SEGS COMMENCED CONSTRUCTION IN OCTOBER 2010 AND IS HALFWAY COMPLETE. IN THE POWER BLOCK AREA, HOME TO THE MAJOR POWER PLANT EQUIPMENT, WORKERS HAVE ERECTED THREE STEEL TOWER STRUCTURES TO SUPPORT THE BOILERS WHICH EXTEND TO A HEIGHT OF 459 FEET, WELDING INTERCONNECTING PIPE INSIDE THE BOILER AND INSTALLING POWER PLANT EQUIPMENT. IN THE SOLAR FIELD, WORKERS ARE INSTALLING THE PROJECT’S 173,000 PYLONS AND HELIOSTATS, WHICH ARE ASSEMBLED ON-SITE AT A RATE OF 500 EACH DAY. TO DATE, WORKERS HAVE INSTALLED MORE THAN 100,000 STEEL PYLONS AND NEARLY 50,000 HELIOSTATS. FOR MORE DETAILS ON CONSTRUCTION PROGRESS, PLEASE SEE OUR BI-MONTHLY UPDATE FROM IVANPAH. NET BENEFIT TO TAXPAYERS FINANCING OF THIS PROJECT WAS FACILITATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY’S 1703 LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM. THE PROJECT'S POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT, AS WELL AS ITS AGGRESSIVE MANAGEMENT OF COST AND SCHEDULE, ASSURE THAT THE LOAN WILL BE PAID BACK, WITH INTEREST, TO THE BENEFIT OF TAXPAYERS. AN ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE PROJECT THE IVANPAH PROJECT WILL REDUCE CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) EMISSIONS BY MORE THAN 400,000 TONS ANNUALLY, WHICH IS THE EQUIVALENT OF TAKING MORE THAN 70,000 CARS OFF THE ROAD. BRIGHTSOURCE’S SYSTEM IS ALSO DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE IMPACTS ON THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION TO BEING ONE OF THE MOST LAND-EFFICIENT RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES, BRIGHTSOURCE’S LOW IMPACT HELIOSTAT LAYOUT IS FLEXIBLE, ALLOWING THE SOLAR FIELD TO BE BUILT AROUND THE NATURAL CONTOURS OF THE LAND AND AVOID AREAS OF SENSITIVE VEGETATION. AND IN ORDER TO CONSERVE SCARCE WATER RESOURCES, THE TECHNOLOGY EMPLOYS AN AIR-COOLING SYSTEM TO CONVERT THE STEAM BACK INTO WATER IN A CLOSED-LOOP CYCLE. BY USING AN AIR-COOLED CONDENSER, BRIGHTSOURCE’S TECHNOLOGY USES MORE THAN 90 PERCENT LESS WATER THAN OLDER TECHNOLOGY PARABOLIC TROUGH PLANTS WITH WET COOLING. ABOUT BRIGHTSOURCE ENERGY, INC.

AS ADDITIONAL COMPANIES JOINED THE CONSPIRACY, COMPETITION AMONG PARTICIPATING COMPANIES FOR SKILLED LABOR DECREASED. COMPENSATION OF DEFENDANTS’ EMPLOYEES WAS LESS THAN WHAT WOULD HAVE PREVAILED IN A PROPERLY FUNCTIONING LABOR MARKET WHERE EMPLOYERS COMPETE FOR WORKERS. THE COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES FOLLOWS AN INVESTIGATION LAST YEAR BY THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE INTO SIMILAR MISCONDUCT BY DEFENDANTS. AFTER THAT INVESTIGATION WAS MADE PUBLIC, DEFENDANTS AGREED TO END THE ANTICOMPETITIVE AGREEMENTS. HOWEVER, NO COMPENSATION WAS PROVIDED TO EMPLOYEES OF DEFENDANTS. TODAY’S CLASS ACTION WAS FILED TO SEEK LOST PAY FOR THE EMPLOYEES WHO WERE TARGETED BY DEFENDANTS’ CONSPIRACY. THE LAWSUIT WAS FILED IN CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. MR. HARIHARAN SEEKS TO REPRESENT A NATIONWIDE CLASS OF ALL EMPLOYEES WHO WERE HARMED BY DEFENDANTS’ UNLAWFUL AGREEMENTS. A COPY OF THE COMPLAINT IS AVAILABLE AT HTTP://WWW.LIEFFCABRASER.COM/ANTITRUST/CASE/344/HIGH-TECH-WORKERS-CLASS-ACTION-LAWSUIT.
